    " * there are several publicly available datasets that can be used for developing decision support systems in diabetes management. Here are a few examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. OhioT1DM Dataset: The OhioT1DM dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/OhioT1DM+Dataset) is a public dataset collected from patients with Type 1 Diabetes. It includes continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data, insulin doses, meal information, physical activity, and physiological features. This dataset is suitable for developing decision support systems for insulin dosing, glucose prediction, and diabetes management.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. T2D-UCI Dataset: The T2D-UCI dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/296/diabetes+130+us+hospitals+for+years+1999+2008) contains data from patients with Type 2 Diabetes, collected from 130 hospitals in the United States between 1999 and 2008. It includes demographic information, clinical factors, medications, and 10-year risk of diabetes-related complications. This dataset can be used for developing decision support systems for risk assessment, treatment planning, and predicting outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Pima Indians Diabetes Database: The Pima Indians Diabetes Database (https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) is a well-known dataset available on Kaggle. It includes data from female Pima Indians, including features such as glucose levels, BMI, age, and diabetes status. This dataset is often used for developing decision support systems for diabetes diagnosis and risk prediction.\n",
    "\n",

    "        * Small data set - only 768 rows \n",
    "        * Can be used to predict Diabetes - The datasets consist of several medical predictor (independent) variables and one target (dependent) variable, Outcome. Independent variables include the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.\n",
    "            * Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Pregnancies, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age, \n",
    "        \n",

    "    4. EHR Datasets: Electronic Health Record (EHR) datasets, such as the MIMIC-III dataset (https://mimic.mit.edu/) and the eICU Collaborative Research Database (https://eicu-crd.mit.edu/), contain anonymized patient data collected from intensive care units. While these datasets cover a wide range of medical conditions, they can be used for developing decision support systems for critical care management in diabetes patients.\n",
