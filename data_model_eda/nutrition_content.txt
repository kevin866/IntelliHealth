Recipes & Nutrition Eating right doesn’t have to be boring.
When it comes to nutrition and diabetes, it’s all about finding the right balance that works for you.







 












 
When you’re managing diabetes and prediabetes, your eating plan is a powerful tool.
But figuring out what to eat can feel like a hassle, right? Well, it doesn't have to because there are easy things you can do to add flavor to your daily routine—including healthy twists on your favorite foods.
One key to feeling your best lies in the food you eat. You can start by working with a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN/RD) to make an eating plan that works for you. In it, be sure to include the foods you like—and don’t be afraid to try something new.
Most importantly, remember that eating well—and adding activity to your daily routine by moving more—are important ways you can manage diabetes. And we’re here to help you every step of the way.
Let's get started.
What does the science say?
"What can I eat?" is one of the top questions asked by people with diabetes when they are diagnosed—and our goal is to help answer that question. A panel of scientists, doctors, endocrinologists, diabetes educators and dietitians reviewed over 600 research articles over the course of five years to see what diets—or eating patterns—work well for people with diabetes. The results were published in our Nutrition Consensus Report.
The main finding? Everyone's body responds differently to different types of foods and diets, so there is no single "magic" diet for diabetes. But you can follow a few simple guidelines to find out what works for you to help manage your blood glucose (blood sugar).
Get the key takeaways
Introducing the Diabetes Plate Method
No matter which eating pattern works best for you, it can still be hard to know where to start when it comes to building healthy meals that help you manage your blood glucose—while still being tasty.
That’s where the Diabetes Plate Method comes in. Using this method, you can create perfectly portioned meals with a healthy balance of vegetables, protein and carbohydrates—without any counting, calculating, weighing or measuring.

And once you’ve got the Plate Method down, check out these tasty plates for some meal planning inspiration!

Antoinette was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes—but she hasn’t let it hold her back.
“During discharge I was given a sheet of paper of things to eat and things to avoid. This was supposed to be my guide for my new life. Although I was overwhelmed, I was determined that I would not let diabetes control my life.”

Now, Antoinette manages her diabetes through a exercise, stress management, medication and a balanced meal plan—and she strives to remove the stigma associated with diabetes and build a community of people actively seeking to improve their health despite their diagnosis.

What you need to know about nutrients
Now that you’ve got the basics, let’s dive into nutrients.
First things first: do you use food labels for products that you buy in the store? The food labels on packaging can be a great place to find information about the nutrients in the food you’re purchasing.
Get smart on food labels


 

















 
Carbs, carbs, carbs—what about them?
When it comes to managing diabetes, the carbohydrates, or carbs, you eat play an important role. They impact your blood glucose, so remember that balance is key!
There are three main types of carbohydrates in food—starches, sugar and fiber. As you’ll see on the nutrition labels for the food you buy, the term “total carbohydrate” refers to all three of these types.
When it comes to choosing foods with carbs, the goal is to choose carbs that are nutrient-dense, which means they are rich in fiber, vitamins and minerals, and low in added sugars, sodium and unhealthy fats.

How is calcium connected to aging, diabetes, hypoglycemia, and falls? 
Calcium is the most abundant mineral in your body and makes up a lot of your bones and teeth. It keeps your bones and teeth strong and supports your body’s overall structure. Calcium is also used to help your muscles move, helps with blood circulation, and your nerves to transmit messages throughout your body. The other nutrient to know when thinking about calcium is vitamin D. Vitamin D is used to absorb calcium, so without it, it can lead to not getting sufficient amounts of calcium. Also, as we get older, our bodies aren’t as efficient in absorbing calcium.
