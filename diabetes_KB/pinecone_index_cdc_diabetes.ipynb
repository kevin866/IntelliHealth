It contains both a detailed discussion of the science of diabetes and its management, and an explanation of how to use this science to demonstrate coverage under the ADA.\\nThis article explains how to prove that a person with diabetes qualifies as a person with a disability under disability discrimination laws, particularly the Americans with Disabilities Act prior to its amendment in 2008.

      "0.89: What is Diabetes?  Español (Spanish) Print Minus Related Pages With diabetes, your body either doesn't make enough insulin or can't use it as well as it should. Diabetes is a chronic (long-lasting) health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy. Your body breaks down most of the food you eat into sugar (glucose) and releases it into your bloodstream. When your blood sugar goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin. Insulin acts like a key to let the blood sugar into your body’s cells for use as energy. With diabetes, your body doesn’t make enough insulin or can’t use it as well as it should. When there isn’t enough insulin or cells stop responding to insulin, too much blood sugar stays in your bloodstream. Over time, that can cause serious health problems, such as heart disease, vision loss, and kidney disease.\n",

      "0.9: Managing Diabetes Unlike many health conditions, diabetes is managed mostly by you, with support from your health care team (including your primary care doctor, foot doctor, dentist, eye doctor, registered dietitian nutritionist, diabetes educator, and pharmacist), family, and other important people in your life. Managing diabetes can be challenging, but everything you do to improve your health is worth it! You may be able to manage your diabetes with healthy eating and being active, or your doctor may prescribe insulin, other injectable medications, or oral diabetes medicines to help manage your blood sugar and avoid complications. You’ll still need to eat healthy and be active if you take insulin or other medicines. It’s also important to keep your blood pressure and cholesterol close to the targets your doctor sets for you and get necessary screening tests. You’ll need to check your blood sugar regularly. Ask your doctor how often you should check it and what your target blood sugar levels should be.\n",
      "0.89: Make and keep appointments with your health care team (primary care doctor, dentist, foot doctor, eye doctor, and dietitian). An ounce of prevention: Hit the trail with your best buddy. In Charge, But Not Alone You’re in the driver’s seat when it comes to managing your diabetes—watching what you eat, making time for physical activity, taking medicine, checking your blood sugar. Also be sure to talk with your health care team to keep going in the right direction. Everyone’s diabetes is different. Some people will still have complications even with good management. Maybe that’s you—you’ve been trying hard but not seeing results. Or you’ve developed a health problem related to diabetes in spite of your best efforts.\n",
