Question 1 - What are the guidelines for finding an eating pattern that works for me?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer -  The main finding from the Nutrition Consensus Report is that everyone's body responds
differently to different types of foods and diets, so there is no single "magic" diet for diabetes.
However, you can follow the Diabetes Plate Method to create perfectly portioned meals with a healthy
balance of vegetables, protein and carbohydrates—without any counting, calculating, weighing or
measuring. Additionally, you can work with a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN/RD) to make an
eating plan that works for you and includes the foods you like.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 2 - What information can I find on food labels?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer -  You can find information about the nutrients in the food you're purchasing on food labels.
This includes information about carbohydrates, such as total carbohydrates, starches, sugar, and
fiber. You can also find information about added sugars, sodium, and unhealthy fats.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 3 - What tools can I use to know my risk for diabetes?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer -  You can use the Take Our Risk Test tool on the Diabetes website to assess your risk for
diabetes. You can also use the Diabetic Retinopathy Risk Test to assess your risk for diabetic
retinopathy. Additionally, you can consult with a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN/RD) to make
an eating plan that works for you.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 4 - What lifestyle changes can I make to help manage my diabetes?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer -  Making healthy lifestyle changes, such as eating a balanced meal plan, exercising
regularly, and managing stress, can help you manage your diabetes. Working with a registered
dietitian nutritionist (RDN/RD) to create an eating plan that works for you can be a great way to
start.

lifestyle changes such as eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and monitoring blood sugar
levels. Additionally, Type 1 diabetes may require insulin injections, while Type 2 diabetes may

Question 7 - What are the risks of diabetes for cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and
stroke?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer -  People with diabetes are at an increased risk for cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney
disease, and stroke. High blood sugar levels can damage the blood vessels and organs in the body,
leading to an increased risk of these conditions. People with diabetes should work with their
healthcare team to manage their blood sugar levels and reduce their risk of these conditions.

advice, medication and treatments information, mental health support, and tools to know your risk.
They also provide advocacy resources, such as grassroots advocacy, federal advocacy, state advocacy,
and understanding your rights. They also provide professional membership, community, American
Diabetes Month, Project Power Adult Interest Form, and Affordable Insulin.

Question 9 - What is the Diabetes Plate Method?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer -  The Diabetes Plate Method is a way of creating perfectly portioned meals with a healthy
balance of vegetables, protein and carbohydrates—without any counting, calculating, weighing or
measuring. It is recommended by the American Diabetes Association as a way to help people with
diabetes manage their blood glucose.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 10 - What are the nutrients I should be aware of?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer -  When it comes to managing diabetes, the carbohydrates, or carbs, you eat play an important
role. They impact your blood glucose, so remember that balance is key! There are three main types of
carbohydrates in food—starches, sugar and fiber. Additionally, it is important to include foods that
are nutrient-dense, which means they are rich in fiber, vitamins and minerals, and low in added
sugars, sodium and unhealthy fats.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

focuses on providing equitable access to diabetes care and resources for all people living with
diabetes. The initiative includes a range of activities, such as grassroots advocacy, federal and
state advocacy, understanding your rights, engagement platforms, and policy action to lower the cost
of diabetes care.
